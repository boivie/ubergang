# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates to all release branches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this project seriously. If you believe you have found a
security vulnerability, please do not report it via public GitHub issues.
Instead, please use one of the following methods:

### 1. GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting (Preferred)

The most secure way to report a vulnerability is through GitHub's built-in
reporting tool. This allows us to collaborate on a fix in a private environment.

- Navigate to the **"Security"** tab of this repository.
- Click on **"Advisories"** in the left sidebar.
- Click **"Report a vulnerability"**.

### 2. Email

If you prefer not to use GitHub, you can contact the maintainer directly via
email:

- **Email:** [victor@boivie.com](mailto:victor@boivie.com)

Please include a detailed description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce
it, and any potential impact.

## Our Process

You can expect an acknowledgment of your report within 48 hours. We will keep
you updated on our progress as we work to resolve the issue. We kindly ask that
you follow [responsible
disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure) practices and
refrain from disclosing the issue publicly until a fix has been released.
